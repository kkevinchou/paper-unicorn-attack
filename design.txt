Design Details

Controls: 
-Swipe determines direction and magnitude. 
  -magnitude determines added velocity to the base velocity, and after magnitude is added, the unit 
  will deccelerate at a constant rate until it reaches its base velocity.
-If in the middle of a swipe and another swipe is received:
  -add new magnitude to the base velocity (does not stack!) and deccelerate

Game Logic Handling:
-input: character + direction + magnitude
-output (to rendering): list of(character + position + collision[true or false + who they collided with])

-Things we have to handle:
  -Cargo Ship:
    -health
      -if (fireball) { subtract X points from health, where X = damage done by a fireball }
      -else do nothing (planes and dragons by themselves can't damage the cargo plane)
    -position update
  -Fighter plane:
    -health
      -if (hit - i.e. collision with fireball. Do nothing for collision with anything else)
        -HEALTHY -> INJURED, INJURED -> DEAD
      -if (reached DEAD state)
        -use callback: set active boolean to false, sleep for X sec., set active boolean to true,
        update position to beside cargo plan.
    -attack: if tap received, perform dash
      -while (in dash): if collision occurs with a dragon, manage health.
    -position update: use direction + magnitude for plane to get new coordinates
  -Dragons:
    -health (see Fighter Plane)
      -one difference: after setting active boolean to true in DEAD state callback, 
      set position to their side of the map
    -attack: if tap received for Dragon, use fireball
    -position update (see Fighter Plane)

Possible Extras:
-Different Dragon Types

Collisions:
	Cargo plane:
		Fighter: none
		Dragon: dragon takes damage
		Fireball: fireball dies, cargo plane takes damage
	Fighter plane:
		Fighter: none
		Cargo: none
		Dragon: if attack mode => dragon takes dmg; else fighter takes dmg
		Fireball: fireball dies, fighter takes dmg
	Dragon:
		Dragon: none
		Fighter: if fighter attacking => dragon takes dmg; else fighter takes dmg
		Cargo: dragon takes dmg
		Fireball: none
	Fireball:
		Fighter: fireball dies, fighter takes dmg
		Cargo: fireball dies, fighter takes dmg
		Dragon: none
		Fireball: none
		
EventTypes:
	"dragonDie" - dying dragon
	"fireballDie" - dying fireball
